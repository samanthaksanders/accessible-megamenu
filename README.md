# Accessible Megamenu

> Keyboard and screen reader accessible megamenu in vanilla js

For those intense dropdown menus with some or many child links to navigate. 

Inspire by [Adobe's jQuery Accessible Mega Menu](https://adobe-accessibility.github.io/Accessible-Mega-Menu/) and guided by [WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices 1.1 Navigation menubar](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/examples/menubar/menubar-1/menubar-1.html).

Note: this is not a drilldown menu. It is simply one level that handles navigating links inside a singular dropdown panel area for each main nav item.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) to avoid webpack janitoring.
